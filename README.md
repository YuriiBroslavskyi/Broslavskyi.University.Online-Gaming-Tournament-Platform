## Project Architecture Documentation

**Folder Structure:**

1. **Client:**
   - **Public:** Contains static assets like HTML files, images, and favicon.
   - **Src:**
     - **App:** Main application component responsible for rendering routes and managing state.
     - **Components:** Reusable UI components used throughout the application.
     - **Context:** Context providers for managing global state using React Context API.
     - **Css:** Stylesheets for styling components and pages.
     - **Pages:** React components representing different pages of the application.

2. **Server:**
   - **Config:** Configuration files for the server, such as environment variables and database configurations.
   - **Src:**
     - **Controllers:** Handlers for processing incoming requests and generating responses.
     - **Models:** Database schema definitions using Mongoose.
     - **Routes:** Express.js route definitions for handling API endpoints.
     - **Utils:** Utility functions used across the server-side codebase.

**Backend Architecture:**
- The server-side architecture is based on the Express.js framework, providing a robust and flexible foundation for building web applications.
- Routes defined in the `routes` directory handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate processing to appropriate controller functions.
- Controller functions interact with database models defined in the `models` directory to perform CRUD operations and business logic.
- Middleware functions can be utilized for tasks such as request validation, authentication, and error handling.

**Frontend Architecture:**
- The frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Components in the `components` directory encapsulate UI elements and can be reused across different pages.
- Context providers defined in the `context` directory manage global state, enabling communication between components.
- CSS stylesheets in the `css` directory provide styling for components and pages, following modular and responsive design principles.

**Authentication:**
- Authentication is implemented using Passport.js middleware, providing authentication strategies for various providers (OAuth).
- User authentication state is managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) stored in local storage.

**Database Schema:**
- Database schema definitions are created using Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
- Schemas defined in the `models` directory represent different data entities and define their structure, validation rules, and relationships.

**Deployment:**
- Deployment configuration and environment variables are stored in the `config` directory, facilitating seamless deployment to various hosting platforms.

**Notification System** 
- After creating tournament or changing any league, all users will be informed about its creation in latest event tab.

**Feedback Mechanism**
- Users can provide feedback on tournaments, leagues, and overall platform experience to help improve future events. For better filtering of feedbacks, users can select a topic(e.g league issue, tournament issue etc.).

**Prize Distribution**
- Users can manage the distribution of prizes for tournament winners through the platform.
